# Kustomize patches for configuring Armory Continuous Deployment

This repository contains example [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io) resources to
configure and deploy Armory Continuous Deployment to your Kubernetes cluster
using the [Armory Operator][operator-overview].

## Disclaimer

The example configurations provided in this repository serve as a starting
point for configuring Armory Continuous Deployment. You may need to modify the
contents for the target environment to work properly. These examples are not
exhaustive and don't showcase all available combinations of settings. It's
possible that not all configurations work with all versions of Armory
Continuous Delivery.

## System Requirements

See our [System Requirements] page for more details.

## Components

This repository makes use of [Kustomize Components] to make configuration
simpler for evaluation purposes.

### Persistence

There are two options for persisting cluster metadata. For instructions on
configuring each, consult the associated READMEs.

- [in-cluster]
- [s3][s3-persistence]

## All-in-one deployment script

This repo provides a one-click `deploy.sh` script that deploys the Armory
Operator in `cluster` mode and then Armory Continuous Deployment. This is useful
for a proof of concept, but you should not use this script in a production
environment.

Clone this repository and run `./deploy.sh`.

The script does the following:

* Deploys the Armory Operator to the `spinnaker-operator` namespace.
* Deploys a basic Armory Continuous Deployment instance with some default
  integrations to the `spinnaker` namespace.

If you already have the Armory Operator deployed, you can use
`SPIN_OP_DEPLOY=0` to specify not to deploy the Operator.

### Deploy open source Spinnaker

#### Deploy Spinnaker Operator open source

```shell
# Pick a release from https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-operator/releases (or clone the repo and use the master branch for the latest development work)
mkdir -p spinnaker-operator && cd spinnaker-operator
bash -c 'curl -L https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-operator/releases/latest/download/manifests.tgz | tar -xz'
 
# Install or update CRDs cluster wide
kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/

# Install operator in namespace spinnaker-operator, see below if you want a different namespace
kubectl create ns spinnaker-operator
kubectl -n spinnaker-operator apply -f deploy/operator/cluster
```


#### Deploy Spinnaker

You can use oss recipes to deploy Spinnaker instead of Armory Continuous
Delivery.

```shell
# Delete default recipe
rm kustomization.yaml

# Create symlink for oss recipe
ln -s ./recipes/kustomization-oss-minimum.yml kustomization.yaml

# Create the spinnaker namespace
kubectl create ns spinnaker

# Build the kustomize template and deploy in kubernetes
kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
```

When you use an oss recipe, it does the following:

* Modifies relevant patch files, replacing `apiVersion:
  spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2` with `apiVersion: spinnaker.io/v1alpha2`.
* Deploys a basic of Spinnaker to the `spinnaker` namespace.


## Add remote clusters script

For adding remote Kubernetes clusters to Armory Continuous Deployment, you can
use the helper script `secrets/create-kubeconfig.sh` to create a Kubernetes
service account (with cluster admin role) and its corresponding `kubeconfig`
file for Armory Continuous Deployment to use.
